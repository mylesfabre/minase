TESTING:
- pytest -q test_pid_quiver.py

FILES:
- pid_quiver.py : Reusable module with P&ID to Quiver mapping, GNN tensors, and SingleComponentFailure utilities.
- example_flow.json : Source to Sink demo with a pump and valve.
- example_loop.json : Closed loop with a level transmitter.

TO USE,
1. Use/update example_flow.json and example_loop.json
2. run the following command in terminal:
    python3 demo.py

TIPS:
- change dinic_maxflow() to dinic_maxflow_pid() to use PID Objects directly

INFO:
	A P&ID (piping & instrumentation diagram) is usually interpreted visually. By encoding it as a graph/quiver, we translate pipes, pumps, valves, sensors into nodes and edges with capacity, direction, and state.
	‚Ä¢	This makes the system computable ‚Äî you can run graph algorithms (flow, reliability, controllability) directly instead of manually inspecting schematics.


MaxFlow & Dinic‚Äôs Algorithm enables Capacity Analysis
	‚Ä¢	The max flow represents the theoretical throughput of a process unit or network (e.g., how much material can reach a reactor).
	‚Ä¢	Using Dinic‚Äôs (or Edmonds‚ÄìKarp earlier) means the computation scales better for large P&ID systems with hundreds of components.
	‚Ä¢	This provides a quantitative benchmark: the maximum safe operating rate before bottlenecks appear.


Resilience Analysis to Single Component Failure
	‚Ä¢	By systematically removing each edge and recomputing flow, the resilience function reveals:
	‚Ä¢	Which component failures degrade performance the most.
	‚Ä¢	Redundancy in parallel paths (robust design).
	‚Ä¢	Vulnerable bottlenecks (single points of failure).
	‚Ä¢	This directly supports HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) studies and FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) in industrial engineering.

Link to Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA in industrial engineering is often used for multivariate process monitoring (many correlated sensor signals).
	‚Ä¢	The graph embedding of the P&ID can be treated as a structural prior for PCA:
	‚Ä¢	Instead of treating every sensor independently, you know which nodes interact via pipes/flows.
	‚Ä¢	You can cluster correlated signals by graph connectivity, improving interpretability of PCA loadings.
	‚Ä¢	Resilience scores can serve as features in PCA space:
			e.g., include resilience ratio under edge failures as meta-features when analyzing system stability.
	‚Ä¢	PCA shifts from just statistical dimensionality reduction to process-aware anomaly detection guided by physical connectivity.

Value to Industrial Engineering
	1.	Model-based monitoring: Algorithms grounded in the P&ID itself, not just black-box data.
	2.	Predictive reliability: Quantify how process flow degrades under failures.
	3.	Safer operations: Identify single points of failure before commissioning or during revamp.
	4.	Enhanced PCA: Integrate structure & data, making fault detection more explainable.
	5.	Digital twin: You‚Äôre basically building a graph-based digital twin that can connect to real-time plant data.

üëâüèæ So, holistically, this code improves industrial engineering PCA by embedding physical plant topology into data analysis, turning PCA into a process-aware diagnostic tool instead of a purely statistical one.
